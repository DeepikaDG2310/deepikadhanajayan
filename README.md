## Profile Summary:

I am dedicated to the pursuit of research and committed to growing alongside emerging technologies. My objective is to cultivate a career that allows me to incessantly expand my knowledge and seamlessly integrate newfound insights into practical applications. This approach enables me to contribute significantly to the growth and success of the organization that entrusts me with opportunities.
As someone who loves to learn, and engage in practical work, I am seeking an opportunity where I can both learn and implement my skills simultaneously. I am a perpetual student, always striving to acquire new skills and expand my knowledge base.

Some say having two domains of interest is not an indication of dedication, but I differ from that. I am genuinely passionate about both fields. As someone interested in research, I see AI as a main component that will be used in all fields. Cyber defense, on the other hand, is integral as it protects AI from malicious attacks or misuse(not just AI, defends.
